# Supplementary Files  

Repository: [GitHub - braindecoding/supl](https://github.com/braindecoding/supl)  

The **Supplementary Files** directory contains two subfolders under the **experiments** folder:  
1. **miawaki** – using the Miyawaki dataset  
2. **vg** – using the Van Gerven dataset  

## Miawaki Folder  

This folder contains experiments using the Miyawaki dataset, including:  
- Reports in **.xlsx** and **.csv** formats  
- **knn** folder: plots of results for each batch, iteration, etc.  

## VG Folder  

This folder contains:  
- Reports in **.csv** and **.xlsx** formats  
- **plot** folder: reports for each iteration, batch, **z** value, and intermediate dimension analysis  

Running **runvg.bat** inside the **plot** folder generates **FID_Result.csv**, along with calculations and reconstructed images for each latent variable, intermediate dimension, batch size, and iteration.
